description:
  Play-test the game in a real browser to check that a change works, reproduce a bug, or see what is on screen. Use
  whenever you changed gameplay, input, drawing, or anything the player sees, or the user asks to test, try, play, or
  check the game, even if they just say 'does it work now?' or 'try it'.

# Test the game

Open the game, press keys, and read the game's numbers to check that it does what you expect.

The game draws everything into one `<canvas>`, so a page snapshot or accessibility tree shows nothing useful: there are
no buttons or text on the page to read. Read the game's state through JavaScript instead of guessing from pixels.

There are two ways to do that, with the same results:

- **In a browser tool that can run JavaScript in the page and press keys**, such as the browser pane in the Claude
  desktop app. Follow the browser steps below.
- **From the terminal, with `npx blit play`.** This works in any assistant, including Cursor: Cursor's built-in browser
  can open the page and take screenshots, but it cannot run JavaScript or press keys, so it cannot read the game's
  state.

## When to use

Use this after a change to gameplay, input, or drawing, to reproduce a bug the user described, or when the user says
"test it", "try it", "play it", or "does it work now?"

## From the terminal (works in any assistant)

```sh
npx blit play --seed 42 wait:1000 state hold:ArrowLeft:500 state shot
```

That starts the dev server, opens the game in the Chrome or Edge on this computer, focuses the canvas, runs the steps in
order, and prints one JSON line per step.

- Steps: `wait:<ms>`, `press:<key>`, `hold:<key>:<ms>`, `move:<x>:<y>`, `click:<x>:<y>` (game pixels), `state`,
  `shot[:<file.png>]` (saved under `screenshots/`, ignored by git), `eval:<expression>`.
- Options: `--seed <n>`, `--backend software`, `--url <url>` (use a dev server that is already running), `--headed`
  (show the browser window). `npx blit play --help` lists them all.
- The first time, it may say it needs the `playwright-core` package and print the command that adds it. Run that command
  once, then try again. It uses the browser you already have and never downloads one.
- Timing is steadier than a browser tool: all steps run in one process, with no pause between tool calls.

## In a browser tool

1. Start the dev server with the `run` skill (`npm run dev`). Leave it running.
2. Open the game with a fixed seed: `http://localhost:5173/?nosplash&seed=42` (use the port the server printed).
   - `seed=42` makes every random roll the same on every run, so two tests can be compared. Any whole number works.
   - `nosplash` skips the BLIT386 splash. A dev build already skips it, so this matters for a built game you open with
     `vite preview`. If the game's `configure()` sets `isSplashEnabled`, that setting wins over the URL.
   - Add `&backend=software` when the browser has no WebGPU, or to test what players without WebGPU get. `software` is
     the only value it accepts.
3. Give the canvas keyboard focus without clicking it: run `document.querySelector('canvas').focus()` in the page. A
   click makes the pointer active, and the starter game then steers the paddle with the mouse and ignores the keys.
4. Read the state. Run this JavaScript in the page:

   ```js
   window.__game.state();
   ```

   It returns plain numbers, for example `{ ticks, score, lives, paddle: { x, y, ... }, items: [...] }`. Read it twice
   about a second apart: `ticks` should have grown by about 60.

5. Press keys, then read the state again. Keys use `KeyboardEvent.code` names: `KeyA`, `KeyD`, `ArrowLeft`, `Space`.
   Player 0 uses W, A, S, D and Space out of the box; the starter game also maps the left and right arrow keys.
   - A quick tap from your browser tool's key-press action is enough for things that react to one press (`BT.isPressed`:
     jump, fire, menu confirm).
   - Movement that happens while a key is held (`BT.isDown`, like the starter's paddle) needs a real hold. A tap is
     usually over before the game's next step and does nothing. Hold the key from JavaScript instead:

     ```js
     const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
     canvas.dispatchEvent(new KeyboardEvent('keydown', { code: 'KeyA', bubbles: true }));
     await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); // hold for half a second
     canvas.dispatchEvent(new KeyboardEvent('keyup', { code: 'KeyA', bubbles: true }));
     ```

   The game runs in real time (about 60 steps a second), so read the state afterward instead of assuming how far
   something moved.

6. Grab an exact frame when you need to see the picture:

   ```js
   await window.__game.frame(); // a PNG data URL of the next frame
   ```

   This is sharper than a browser screenshot: it is the game's own pixels, not scaled by the page. It matches
   `BT.outputSize`, though, which for the starter game is `640x480` - every game pixel a 2x2 block. For a 1:1 frame at
   `BT.displaySize` (`320x240`), the size that pixel comparisons want, use the engine call directly (engine 1.7.1+):

   ```js
   await window.BT.captureFrame({ size: 'display' }); // a PNG Blob, one pixel per game pixel
   ```

   See `save-a-screenshot` for the difference between the two sizes.

## What a healthy run looks like

- From the terminal: the last line shows `"errors":[]` and the exit code is 0. Any error the page logs fails the run.
- In a browser tool: `ticks` climbs between two reads, and the browser console shows no errors.
- The numbers you meant to change moved the way you expected (the score went up after a catch, the paddle's `x` went
  down while `KeyA` was held).
- The same seed and the same steps give the same result. Seeded values (where blocks appear, how far they fell by a
  given tick) match exactly across runs. Values you steered can differ by a step or two, because a key press lands in
  real time, not on an exact tick.

## Notes

- `window.__game` is the starter game's own code in `src/game.*`: look for `window.__game` in `init()`. Add a field to
  `state()` when you need to check something new, for example `level: this.level`. Keep it plain numbers, strings, and
  arrays so it can be printed.
- An older game without `window.__game` still has `window.BT` in a dev build: `BT.ticks`, `BT.activeBackend`, and
  `BT.captureFrame()` (it returns a PNG `Blob`; pass `{ size: 'display' }` on engine 1.7.1+ for a 1:1 frame) work
  straight away, and the terminal `state` step falls back to `BT.ticks`. See `use-dev-mode`.
- Both `window.__game` and `window.BT` exist only while the dev server runs the game. A built game has neither.
- `?seed=` only helps if the game rolls dice with `BT.random`, not `Math.random()`. See `use-random`.
- If the browser pane or tab is hidden, the browser slows the game down or stops it completely: `ticks` climbs slowly or
  not at all, and `document.visibilityState` reads `hidden`. Show the pane again, or use `npx blit play`, before testing
  anything that depends on timing.
- If nothing happens when you press keys, the canvas has lost focus, the pointer has taken over the paddle, or a key
  that must be held was only tapped. Focus the canvas again with `document.querySelector('canvas').focus()`, keep the
  mouse off it, and hold movement keys as in step 5.
